Configuration File Sets
===========================

----------------------
The example set
----------------------

For instructional purposes, we provide an example configuration set that creates a three detector H1L1V1 search on S6 data. It is broken into three pieces, the core search, the injection sets, 
and the postprocessing.

There are two options for the core search. 

* example_pycbc.ini
 Use PyCBC executables for template placement and matched-filtering.
* example_lalapps.ini
 Use Lalapps executables for template placement and matched-filtering.

The post-processing and injections are available in the following ini files. 

* example_pipedown.ini
* example_inj.ini
