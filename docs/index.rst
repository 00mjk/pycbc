PyCBC documentation
###################

PyCBC is a python toolkit for analysis of data from gravitational-wave laser interferometer detectors with the goal of detecting and studying signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs).

The goals of the PyCBC project are to

- Create a flexible, extensible sw production code for CBC analysis that can be released for the public
- Enable simple, easy and transparent access for various many-core architectures like GPUs
- Ultimately become the data analysis tool of the 'advanced era'
