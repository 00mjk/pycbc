Ahope: the inspiral analysis workflow generator (``pycbc.ahope``)
##################################################################

============
Introduction
============

Ahope is a tool used to create the workflows needed to perform coincident analyses of gravitational-wave data searching for compact-binary-coalescences using matched-filtering.

The ahope workflow runs through a number of stages, which are designed to be as independent of each other as possible, while also allowing an integrated end-to-end workflow to be constructed.

Documentation of the ahope executable and how to run it can be found here.

Please see the `following poster <https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-G1400223>`_, presentied at the March LVC meeting, 2014, for an introduction to ahope. Especially see the following ahope top-level workflow generation model.

Each of the sections is described in detail below.

Ahope to do list
=======================

This list is now maintained `as a wiki <https://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/ligovirgo/cbcnote/AhopeToDoList>`_; please see that wiki to view items on the list or update their status. **PLEASE** take on an item from this list. If you do, please update the wiki and ensure that any changes are reflected in both the in-line documentation and the html web pages.

====================
Examples
====================

Some examples of how to run ahope in different configurations can be found
in the source tree under::

    pycbc/examples/ahope

These examples are described in each section below

---------------------
weekly_ahope
---------------------

This is an example of how to run a coincidence ahope workflow, mimicking standard ihope coincidence analysis as closely as possible. It calls into pipedown to do the post-processing and using write_ihope_page to make an output html page. In total this will:

* Get science and data-quality segments from the server.
* Query the datafind server for frames.
* Create the template bank jobs needed to cover the times
* Split the template banks (into whatever number is specified in the ini file). This step could be easily removed, just delete this module in the python file and send the matched-filtering code the template bank input directly.
* Run the matched-filtering code on the split template banks
* Use ligolw_add and ligolw_sstinca to generate coincidence triggers
* Do some compatibility conversions and then call pipedown to create a dag to do the post-processing
* Add a node to run write_ihope_page at the end of analysis
* Native post-processing is also present in a testing mode, this will not be seen in the default output page, but does include a full set of plots.
* Write a dag/dax to file that can be submitted to run the workflow

This will therefore set up a *almost complete* mimic of a weekly ihope analysis and automatically generate the output webpage at the end of the analysis.

More details of how to run this is found in the following link:

-------------------
er_daily_ahope
-------------------

This is an example of how to run an ahope workflow mimicing the daily_ihope analysis done in the past. This will:

* Get science and data-quality segments from the server.
* Query the datafind server for frames.
* Create the template bank jobs needed to cover the times
* Split the template banks (into 2). This step could be easily removed, just delete this module in the python file and send the matched-filtering code the template bank input directly.
* Run the matched-filtering code on the split template banks
* Call into the code that generates the dag for running daily_ihope pages and plots and adds this dag to the workflow.
* Write a dag/dax to file that can be submitted to run the workflow

This will therefore set up a *complete* daily_ahope workflow and automatically generate the webpage at the end of the analysis.

This is currently being used in ER5 as a supplement and backup to the daily_ihope runs. 

More details of how to run this is found in the following link:

   ahope/daily_ahope

---------------------
data_checker
---------------------

This is an example of using only the segment query and datafind query modules
of ahope, with all checking options enabled. This will do the following

* Use the supplied information in the veto-definer file query for science times
* Using the veto-definer file query for CAT1,2,3,4,5 times
* Connect to the datafind server and query for frames at the times given in science - CAT1 (frame types provided in .ini file)
* Check that frames have been returned at all times that are given as science (-CAT1) by the segment server. Fail if not (this can be changed to update the science times, but here we want to fail if data is not present)
* Run os.path.is_file() on every frame file that was returned by datafind. This can be slow if run on long periods of time and if the fileservers are slow. Not recommended for a full ahope run at present, but useful for daily [a,i]hope runs.

This example can be edited for any time you are interested in and can be used to identify missing data before submitting a workflow.

Ahope module documentation
===========================

The following contains a list of ahope's modules, a bried description of what each does, and a link to documentation on how to use each module. Collectively these pages should provide complete details on how to set up a workflow from scratch.

--------------------
Initialization
--------------------

Take in command line input and the configuration file.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ahope/initialization

--------------------
Generating segments
--------------------

Obtain the science segments and data-quality segments from making queries to a segment database.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ahope/segments

--------------------
Obtaining data
--------------------

Run queries to the datafind server to find the needed frames and test these for
consistency if desired

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

----------------------------

Generate injection files for use later in the analysis

----------------------------------

Generate the time-slide files used for describing time slides to be performed later in the analysis

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

Template bank
----------------------------------

Construct a template bank, or banks, of CBC waveforms that will be used to matched-filter the data with.

Split table
----------------------------------

Split an output file into numerous parts to allow parallel analysis. Normally used to split the template bank up to allow matched-filtering in parallel
