Introduction
===================

This page gives details on how to use the various bank generation codes
available in pyCBC and the pyCBC.tmpltbank module. These codes currently
consist of 

* A program to generate a non-spinning template bank
* A program to generate an aligned-spin template bank using a geometrical lattice algorithm
* A program to generate an aligned-spin template bank using a stochastical placement algorithm.

Each of these codes is described in turn and is accompanied by some examples of how to run the code, some relevant background and references and the options described from the codes' help messages.

The output of all these codes is currently a sngl_inspiral_table XML object.
However, if people want to output in SQL or other formats it should be
easy to write a back-end module to do this. The code may not fill every
necessary column of the sngl_inspiral table, please let me know if something
is missing and it will be added!

Non spin bank placement: pycbc_geom_nonspinbank
=================================================

---------------------
Overview
---------------------

pycbc_geom_nonspinbank is designed as a drop in replacement for 
lalapps_tmpltbank. It uses a globally flat coordinate system, which enables it
to easily place banks at 3.5PN order (and higher order as these become available).

Mapping back from the new coordinate system to masses and spins makes the bank
placement slower than lalapps_tmpltbank. However, it doesn't waste stupid
amounts of time calculating the ethinca metric so it is faster than tmpltbank
if the ethinca components are being computed.

The ethinca metric is currently hardcoded to 2PN. If someone wants to add the
terms up to 3.5PN this can be fixed.

----------------
Background
----------------

The methods, specifically the metric and the lattice algorithm, used in
lalapps_tmpltbank are described in:

* Sathyaprakash, B. S. and Dhurandhar, S. V., Phys.Rev. D44 3819  (1991)
* Poisson, Eric and Will, Clifford M., Phys.Rev. D52 848 (1995)
* Balasubramanian, R. et al., Phys.Rev. D53 3033 (1996)
* Owen, Benjamin J., Phys.Rev. D53 6749 (1996)
* Owen, Benjamin J. and Sathyaprakash, B. S., Phys.Rev. D60 022002 (1998)
* Babak, S. et al., Class.Quant.Grav. 23, 5477 (2006)
* Cokelaer, Thomas Phys.Rev. D76 102004 (2007)
* Babak, S. et al., Phys.Rev. D87 024033 (2013)

Our approach still uses the hexagonal lattice algorithm but instead of using
the chirp times as coordinates uses the xi_i coordinate system described in:

* Brown, Duncan A. et al. Phys.Rev. D86 084017 (2012)
* Ohme, Frank et al. Phys.Rev. D88 024002 (2013)

This allows us to easily use higher order terms in the metric placement as we
do not have to worry about correlations between tau 0 and 3 and the other
coordinates. Our coordinates are independent.

The issue is that unlike in the lalapps_tmpltbank approach it is not trivial
to map back from our coordinates to masses. Currently we use a monte-carlo
approach to find mass positions fitting the desired coordinates. If we could
implement some form of 2D interpolation this would probably be much faster.
If anyone wants to investigate this I can provide lots of data!

-------------------
Some examples
-------------------

This first example computes a non-spinning template bank using a supplied ASD text file. It also calculates the ethinca components

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_geom_nonspinbank --pn-order twoPN --f0 40 --f-low 40 --f-upper 2048 --delta-f 0.01 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.0 --min-mass2 2.0 --max-mass1 3. --max-mass2 3. --verbose --output-file testNonSpin.xml --calculate-ethinca-metric --asd-file ZERO_DET_high_P.txt

Here is a second example that computes a non-spinning template bank from a frame
cache file. This needs a bunch more options to read data and estimate the PSD
from that.

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_geom_nonspinbank --pn-order twoPN --f0 40 --f-low 40 --f-upper 2048 --delta-f 0.01 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.0 --min-mass2 2.0 --max-mass1 3. --max-mass2 3. --verbose --output-file testNonSpin.xml --calculate-ethinca-metric --psd-estimation median --psd-segment-length 256 --psd-segment-stride 128 --psd-inverse-length 8 --gps-start-time 900000033 --gps-end-time 900002081 --strain-high-pass 30 --pad-data 8 --sample-rate 4096 --frame-cache cache/H-H1_NINJA2_G1000176_EARLY_RECOLORED_CACHE-900000024-10653.lcf --channel-name H1:LDAS-STRAIN --max-total-mass 5.5 --min-total-mass 4.5

--------------------------
Command line options
--------------------------

The command line options read as follows

.. command-output:: pycbc_geom_nonspinbank --help

Some notes on these options:

* The value of f0 generally doesn't matter (so just use 70 if unsure). However if ethinca is being calculated f0 and f-low must be equal.
* Choose f-upper wisely! If your signals coalesce at <1000Hz, you might want to use a lower value ... although of course in this regime this inspiral-only metric will lose validity.
* A delta-f value of 1/256 will certainly be accurate enough, but setting this lower will lead to the code being faster.

=============================================================
Aligned-spin geometric placement: pycbc_geom_aligned_bank
=============================================================

---------------------
Overview
---------------------

pycbc_geom_aligned_bank is a code for placing of aligned-spin banks using the
TaylorF2 metric (or TaylorR2F4, which is an approximation of TaylorT4).

This code will begin by generating a dag, which the user submits, that will
generate the final template bank. This code will not calculate ethinca, as
ethinca is not defined for spinning waveforms. However, if a new coincidence
scheme is developed it could be used in that. This code has already been used
in two published works, has been run through the GRB code, MBTA and in
ahope development work ongoing at AEI.

If any problems are encountered please email ian.harry@ligo.org.

----------------
Background
----------------

This code build upon the methods used to calculate the metric used in
lalapps_tmpltbank. For details of how this code works see:

* Phys.Rev. D86 (2012) 084017
* arXiv:1307.3562

As with our non-spinning generator we place a lattice in the flat xi_i
coordinate system and then map the points back to physical coordinates. In
doing so we remove points that are too far away from the physical space, and
push points that are outside the space, but overlap with it, back into the
physical space.

This is all done with monte-carlo techniques, which is why this code requires
a dag. If there were a more efficient way to map xi_i coordinates to physical
values it will **massively** speed this code up. Please contact me if you
want to play around with this.


--------------------
Some examples
--------------------

The command line arguments given to this code are very similar to those given
to the non-spinning code (not surprising as they actually use the same modules).

Here is one example for making an aligned-spin template bank using a pre-generated ASD file.

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_geom_aligned_bank --pn-order threePointFivePN --f0 70 --f-low 15 --f-upper 1000 --delta-f 0.01 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.5 --min-mass2 2.5 --max-mass1 3. --max-mass2 3. --verbose --log-path /usr1/spxiwh/logs --max-ns-spin-mag 0.05 --max-bh-spin-mag 0.05 --output-file testAligned.xml --split-bank-num 5 --asd-file ZERO_DET_high_P.txt

* To avoid generating a NSBH bank where you have a wall of triggers with NS mass = 3 and spins up to the black hole maximum use the nsbh-flag. This will ensure that only neutron-star--black-hole systems are generated.

Aligned-spin stochastic placement: pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank
============================================================

------------------
Introduction
------------------

pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank is an aligned-spin bank generator that uses a
stochastic algorithm and the TaylorF2 (or TaylorR2F4) metric to create a bank
of templates.

This code does not require the processing power of the geometric lattice
algorithm and does not produce a dag. Run the command, wait, get bank.

------------------
Background
------------------

As opposed to geometric algorithms where the metric is used to determine a
lattice of equally placed points, a stochastic algorithm works by creating
a large set of randomly placed points and then using the metric (or actually
computing overlaps) to remove points that are too close to each other.

This algorithm has the benefit that it can work in any parameter space, you
do not require a flat metric. However, it does require more templates to cover
a space than a geometric approach. Additionally the computational cost will
increase as a factor of the number of points in the bank to a power between 2 and 3 - the exact number depends on how well you are able to optimize the parameter space and not match **every** point in the bank with every seed point.
Nevertheless we have found that the computational cost is not prohibitive for
aLIGO-size spinning banks.

Stochastic placement was first proposed in terms of LISA searches in

* Harry et al. Class.Quant.Grav. 25 (2008) 184027
* Babak Class.Quant.Grav. 25 (2008) 195011

and then described in more detail in

* Harry et al. Phys.Rev. D80 (2009) 104014 
* Manca and Vallisneri Phys.Rev. D81 (2010) 024004

Recently stochastic placement has been explored for LIGO searches in

* Ajith et al. arXiv:1210.6666
* Privitera et al. arXiv:1310.5633 

The method presented here follows the method described in Harry et al. (2009)
and calculates matches using a metric (in this case the F2 or R2F4 metrics).
An alternative code "sBank" (which hopefully can be migrated into this module??)
is available for creating banks of stochastically generated signals with or
without a metric. In the absence of a metric it uses the method introduced in
Babak (2008) and used in Ajith (2012) and Privitera (2013) to compute distances
between points by generating both waveforms and calculating an explicit overlap.

--------------------
Some examples
--------------------

The command line arguments given to this code are very similar to those given
to the non-spinning code and the aligned-spin geometric code (not surprising as they actually use the same modules).

Here is one example reading data from a frame cache, as in the non-spinnin example

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank -v --pn-order threePointFivePN --f0 60 --f-low 30 -V --delta-f 0.01 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.5 --max-mass1 3 --min-mass2 2.5 --max-mass2 3 --max-ns-spin-mag 0.05 --max-bh-spin-mag 0.05 --nsbh-flag --psd-estimation median --psd-segment-length 256 --psd-segment-stride 128 --psd-inverse-length 8 --gps-start-time 900000033 --gps-end-time 900002081 --strain-high-pass 30 --pad-data 8 --sample-rate 4096 --frame-cache cache/H-H1_NINJA2_G1000176_EARLY_RECOLORED_CACHE-900000024-10653.lcf --channel-name H1:LDAS-STRAIN --verbose --output-file testStoch.xml --num-seeds 2000000

Another example where we read the PSD from a supplied ASD file:

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank -v --pn-order threePointFivePN --f0 60 --f-low 30 --delta-f 0.1 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.5 --max-mass1 3 --min-mass2 2.5 --max-mass2 3 --max-ns-spin-mag 0.05 --max-bh-spin-mag 0.05 --nsbh-flag --verbose --asd-file ZERO_DET_high_P.txt --num-seeds 10000 --output-file "testStoch.xml"

And a third example where we use a batshit PN order.

.. code-block:: bash

    pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank -v --pn-order onePN --f0 60 --f-low 30 --delta-f 0.1 --min-match 0.97 --min-mass1 2.5 --max-mass1 3 --min-mass2 2.5 --max-mass2 3 --max-ns-spin-mag 0.05 --max-bh-spin-mag 0.05 --nsbh-flag --verbose --asd-file ZERO_DET_high_P.txt --num-seeds 10000 --output-file "testStoch.xml"

--------------------------

.. command-output:: pycbc_aligned_stoch_bank --help

* --num-seeds is the termination condition. The code will throw NUM_SEEDS points at the parameter space, and then filter out those that are too close to each other. If this value is too low, the bank will not converge, if it is too high, the code will take longer to run.
* --num-failed-cutoff can be used as an alternative termination condition. Here the code runs until NUM_FAILED_CUTOFF points have been **consecutively** rejected and will then stop.
* --vary-fupper will allow the code to vary the upper frequency cutoff across the parameter space. Currently this feature is **only** available in the stochastic code. If you are not using this option give --covary. Soon I will figure out how to get these options to play nice and then covary will be on by default and will not be an option.
