    ----------

        The time series to be filtered.
    z: array
        Array of zeros to include in zpk filter design, eg. 3 zeroes at 1Hz

        Array of poles to include in zpk filter design, eg. 3 poles at 100Hz
        would be array([-100., -100., -100.])
    k: float
        Gain to include in zpk filter design. This gain is a contast
        multiplied to the transfer function.

    Returns
    -------
    Time Series: TimeSeries
        A  new TimeSeries that has been filtered.
