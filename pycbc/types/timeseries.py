        This is the Python special method invoked whenever the '=='
        comparison is used.  It will return true if the data of two
        time series are identical, and all of the numeric meta-data
        are identical, irrespective of whether or not the two
        instances live in the same memory (for that comparison, the
        Python statement 'a is b' should be used instead).

        Thus, this method returns 'True' if the types of both 'self'
        and 'other' are identical, as well as their lengths, dtypes,
        epochs, delta_ts and the data in the arrays, element by element.
        It will always do the comparison on the CPU, but will *not* move
        either object to the CPU if it is not already there, nor change
        the scheme of either object. It is possible to compare a CPU
        object to a GPU object, and the comparison should be true if the
        data and meta-data of the two objects are the same.

        Note in particular that this function returns a single boolean,
        and not an array of booleans as Numpy does.  If the numpy
        behavior is instead desired it can be obtained using the numpy()
        method of the PyCBC type to get a numpy instance from each
        object, and invoking '==' on those two instances.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other: another Python object, that should be tested for equality
            with 'self'.

        Returns
        -------
        boolean: 'True' if the types, dtypes, lengths, epochs, delta_ts
            and data of the two objects are each identical.

        Compare whether two time series are almost equal, element
        by element.

        If the 'relative' parameter is 'True' (the default) then the
        'tol' parameter (which must be positive) is interpreted as a
        relative tolerance, and the comparison returns 'True' only if
             abs(self[i]-other[i]) <= tol*abs(self[i])
        for all elements of the series.

        If 'relative' is 'False', then 'tol' is an absolute tolerance,
        and the comparison is true only if
             abs(self[i]-other[i]) <= tol
        for all elements of the series.

        Other meta-data (type, dtype, length, epoch, and delta_t) must
        be exactly equal.  If either object's memory lives on the GPU it
        will be copied to the CPU for the comparison, which may be slow.
        But the original object itself will not have its memory relocated
        nor scheme changed.

            tolerance.
