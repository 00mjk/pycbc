        This special method is invoked by the '==' operator
        in Python.  The frequency series method overrides that
        in the superclass (which it also calls) by further
        enforcing that the additional meta-data (_epoch and
        _delta_f) also agree between the two frequency series.

        As with the superclass method, the comparison is always
        done on the CPU, wherever the series itself resides, and
        may therefore be slow for GPU arrays.  But it should not
        move the arrays onto the CPU, nor change their scheme.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other: another Python object, that should be tested for
            equality with 'self'.

        Returns
        -------
        boolean: 'True' if the types, data, and meta-data (except
            scheme) of the two objects are each identical.

        Compare whether two frequency series are almost equal, element
        by element.

        If the 'relative' parameter is 'True' (the default) then the
        'tol' parameter (which must be positive) is interpreted as a
        relative tolerance, and the comparison returns 'True' only if
             abs(self[i]-other[i]) <= tol*abs(self[i])
        for all elements of the series.

        If 'relative' is 'False', then 'tol' is an absolute tolerance,

             abs(self[i]-other[i]) <= tol
        for all elements of the series.

        Other meta-data (type, dtype, length, epoch, and delta_f) must
        be exactly equal.  If either object's memory lives on the GPU it
        will be copied to the CPU for the comparison, which may be slow.
        But the original object itself will not have its memory relocated
        nor scheme changed.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other: another Python object, that should be tested for
            almost-equality with 'self', element-by-element.
        tol: a non-negative number, the tolerance, which is interpreted
            as either a relative tolerance (the default) or an absolute
            tolerance.
        relative: A boolean, indicating whether 'tol' should be interpreted
            as a relative tolerance (if True, the default if this argument
            is omitted) or as an absolute tolerance (if tol is False).

        Returns
        -------
        boolean: 'True' if the data agree within the tolerance, as
            interpreted by the 'relative' keyword, and if the types,
            lengths, dtypes, epochs, and delta_fs are exactly the same.
