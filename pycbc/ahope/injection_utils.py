"""
This module is responsible for setting up the part of an ahope workflow that
will generate the injection files to be used for assessing the workflow's
ability to detect predicted signals. (In ihope parlance, this sets up the
inspinj jobs). Full documentation for this module can be found here:
https://ldas-jobs.ligo.caltech.edu/~cbc/docs/pycbc/NOTYETCREATED.html

    '''
    This function is the gateway for setting up injection-generation jobs in an
    ahope workflow. It should be possible for this function to support a number
    of different ways/codes that could be used for doing this, however as this
    will presumably stay as a single call to a single code (which need not be
    inspinj) there are currently no subfunctions in this moudle. 

    Parameters
    -----------
    Workflow : ahope.Workflow
        The ahope workflow instance that the coincidence jobs will be added to.
    output_dir : path
        The directory in which injection files will be stored.
    injSectionName : string (optional, default='injections')
        The string that corresponds to the option describing the exe location
        in the [executables] section of the .ini file and that corresponds to
        the section (and sub-sections) giving the options that will be given to
        the code at run time.
    tags : list of strings (optional, default = [])
        A list of the tagging strings that will be used for all jobs created
        by this call to the workflow. This will be used in output names.

    Returns
    --------
    inj_files : ahope.AhopeFileList
        The list of injection files created by this call.
    inj_tags : list of strings
        The tag corresponding to each injection file and used to uniquely
        identify them. The AhopeFileList class contains functions to search
        based on tags.
