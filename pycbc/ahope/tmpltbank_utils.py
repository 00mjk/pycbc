def setup_tmpltbank_workflow(cp,scienceSegs,ahopeDax):
    '''
    Setup template bank section of ahope workflow. This function is responsible
    for deciding which of the various template bank workflow generation
    utilities should be used. Currently the logic is as follows:
    
    * If pregenerated-template-bank=BANK option in [ahope] section, use
      setup_tmpltbank_pregenerated. This will assume a pregenerated bank called
      BANK is to be used for **all** ahope matched-filtering.

    * Otherwise use setup_tmpltbank_dax_generated. This will assume that the
      template banks are to be generated within the workflow. This will
      generate numerous banks for every ifo, dependent on configuration
      options.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cp : ConfigParser
        The ConfigParser holding all the options used by the ahope workflow.
    scienceSegs : Keyed dictionary of glue.segmentlist objects
        scienceSegs[ifo] holds the science segments to be analysed for each
        ifo. 
    ahopeDax : Instanced CondorDag class
        The CondorDag class that will hold all the jobs that the ahope workflow
        needs to run.

    Returns
    --------
    AhopeOutFileList
        The AhopeOutFileList holding the details of all the template bank jobs.
