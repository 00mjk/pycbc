    workflow. This file may be pre-supplied, generated from within the ahope
    command line script, or generated within the workflow. This class inherits
    from the glue.lal.CacheEntry class and has all attributes/methods of that
    class. It also adds some additional stuff for ahope. The important stuff
    from both is:

    * The location of the output file (which may not yet exist)
    * The ifo that the AhopeOutFile is valid for
    * The time span that the AhopeOutFile is valid for
    * A short description of what the file is
    * The dax job that will generate the output file (if appropriate). If the
      file is generated within the workflow the dax job object will hold all
      the job-specific information that may be relevant for later stages.
