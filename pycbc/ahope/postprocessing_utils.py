    This function aims to be the gateway for running postprocessing in CBC
    offline workflows. Post-processing generally consists of calculating the
    significance of triggers and making any statements about trigger rates.

    Properties
    -----------
    Workflow : ahope.Workflow
        The ahope workflow instance that the coincidence jobs will be added to.
    triggerFiles : ahope.AhopeFileList
        An AhopeFileList of the trigger files that are used as
        input at this stage.
    output_dir : path
        The directory in which output files will be stored.
    tags : list of strings (optional, default = [])
        A list of the tagging strings that will be used for all jobs created
        by this call to the workflow. An example might be ['POSTPROC1'] or
        ['DENTYSNEWPOSTPROC']. This will be used in output names.

    Returns
    --------
    postProcFiles : ahope.AhopeFileList
        A list of the output from this stage.

    This module sets up the post-processing stage in ahope, using a pipedown
    style set up. This consists of running compute_durations to determine and
    store the analaysis time (foreground and background). It then runs cfar
    jobs to determine the false alarm rate for all triggers (simulations or
    otherwise) in the input database.
    Pipedown expects to take as input (at this stage) a single database
    containing all triggers. This sub-module follows that same idea, so
    len(triggerFiles) must equal 1 (for every DQ category that we will run).

    Workflow : ahope.Workflow
        The ahope workflow instance that the coincidence jobs will be added to.
    triggerFiles : ahope.AhopeFileList
        An AhopeFileList containing the combined databases at CAT_1,2,3... that
        will be used to calculate FARs
    output_dir : path
        The directory in which output files will be stored.
    tags : list of strings (optional, default = [])
        A list of the tagging strings that will be used for all jobs created
        by this call to the workflow. An example might be ['POSTPROC1'] or
        ['DENTYSNEWPOSTPROC']. This will be used in output names.
    vetoCats : list of integers (optional, default = [])
        Decide which set of veto files should be used in the post-processing
        preparation. This is used, for example, to tell the workflow that you
        are only interested in quoting results at categories 2, 3 and 4. In
        which case just supply [2,3,4] for those veto files here.
