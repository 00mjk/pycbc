FFTW implementation class of the Fast Fourier Transform

This is a derived class of FastFourierTransformBase, which
implements the constructor and performs the transform of
a Fast Fourier Transform using the FFTW3 library.  It is assumed
that the input and output datavectors are aligned memory, as is
the case in PyCBC.

When an instance of this class is instantiated, you must give
the length of the vectors to be transformed, their type, the
direction of the transform, and the precision of the vectors, as
below:

  MyFFT = FastFourierTransformFFTW(vector_length=1024,
                                   data_type='complex',
                                   transform_direction='forward',
                                   data_precision='double',
                                   measure_level=0)

where:

  data_type            must be  'real' or 'complex'
  transform_direction  must be  'forward' or 'reverse'
  data_precision       must be  'single' or 'double'
  measure_level        must be  0, 1, 2, or 3, and defaults to
                                1 if not given

Other keyword arguments may be given, but they will be ignored.

When the FFT is instantiated, an FFTW plan is created, drawing
on system-wide wisdom if present.  Once this plan is created, the
perform_transform() method of the instance may be called repeatedly
on new input and output vectors, so long as they are the same length,
type, precision, and the same direction of transform and level of
planning is desired.  For example:

 mylen=1024
 output_list = []
 MyFFT = FastFourierTransformFFTW(vector_length=mylen,data_type='complex',
                        transform_direction='forward',data_precision='single')
 for invec in vector_list:
      new_output = complex_vector_single_cpu_t(mylen)
      MyFFT.perform_transform(invec,new_output)
      output_list.append(new_output)

to loop over an existing list of input vectors, creating a list
of their FFT's.
